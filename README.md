### User stories
* I want to watch a movie with my class but we can't decide on what movie to watch.
* I'm at home and I want to be able ot pick an actor or actress that I like, then click a button to randomly generate a movie.

### MVP
* An app with a big button to click on which randomly selects a movie to watch (by genre if desired).
* Have a drop down menu that allows user to select either 'All' genres or by a specific genre.
* Have a database for movies with a title, year and blurb column.
* Have a database with a bunch of genre options.
* Have a database which joins movies with their genres (as some movies may have more than one genre).

### Stretch
* A user can add more movies to the database through a form
